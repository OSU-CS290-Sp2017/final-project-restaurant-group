      		Founded in Corvallis, Oregon, we are a brand new breakfast house with pancakes stacked so high even Benny the Beaver can't reach the top without a ladder! We serve up everything you can think of from [menu item 1] to [menu item 2] and we make it just like your momma makes it when you're home for the holidays! Don't believe us? Well prove us wrong by trying Missy's Breakfast House today! You come anyday of the week and you'll be fed just like you're at Grandma's house! We're located just off of NW Monroe St, right next to Local Boyz Hawaiian Cafe! Go Beavs!
